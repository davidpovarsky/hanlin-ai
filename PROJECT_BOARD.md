# Project Board

This is a living working-memory document for this repository.
It is intentionally lightweight. Humans and coding agents should update it when useful discoveries, ideas, plans, optimizations, problems, or follow-up work arise during normal development.
Do not turn this into a duplicate issue tracker or a dump of temporary thoughts.

## Inbox

Quick captures that still need classification.

## Ideas & Opportunities

Potential improvements, features, optimizations, or architectural ideas.

## Discoveries & Tips

- **CloudKit Container in CI:** On iOS Simulator running in CI without active iCloud entitlements/credentials, `cloudKitDatabase` must be initialized to `.none` to avoid blocking/deadlock during app/agent startup.
- **Node Worker ESM Resolution:** Node 22 exhibited a known worker loader internal assertion failure (`ERR_INTERNAL_ASSERTION: Unexpected module status 3`) on concurrent ESM worker resolution. Resolved cleanly in Node 24.5 (`@cablate/mcp-google-map` passes capability probing with exit code 0).
- **Simulator Concurrency Gates:** In XCTest suites driving async agent loops, unbounded polling loops can cause test runner timeouts. Use bounded timeouts with exponential backoff.
- **Authoritative Defect Identification:** The 6 test failures discovered in Pass 3 were previously mislabeled against scenario IDs SH-03, SH-05, CMD-04, ZIP-04, ZIP-07, ZIP-11. Their root causes were in `loadDescriptor` title propagation (`SkillStore.swift`), atomic rollback metadata preservation (`SkillStore.swift`), internal symlink policy acceptance (`HanlinArchivePolicy.swift`), dual-mode shell tool schema advertisement (`ExecuteShellCommandTool.swift`), obsolete path policy removal from smoke suite (`ShellRuntimeSmokeSuite.swift`), and raw command pipe execution / symlink reading (`HanlinUnifiedHostServicesAgentAcceptanceTests.swift`). All 6 have been fully fixed and verified.
- **Swift 6 Region Isolation on Completion Handlers:** When dispatching completion handlers from non-isolated methods to `DispatchQueue.main.async`, non-Sendable closures trigger `RegionIsolation::SendingRisksDataRace` unless aliased to `nonisolated(unsafe)` before any guard branch.
- **Bash `set -u` Safe Array Expansion:** Expanding an empty array `"${arr[@]}"` under `set -u` aborts with `unbound variable`. Use `"${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}"` for portable, safe expansion.

## In Progress / Active Blockers

None.

## Planned / Todo

- [ ] (Future) Physical Apple hardware device test execution (Layer D) when hardware test bench is provisioned.
- [ ] (Future) Live external cloud model provider end-to-end integration when production credentials are configured.

## Done

- [x] Hanlin Final Semantic Closure & Authoritative Evidence Pipeline (Rescue Pass)
  - Implemented: 2026-10-12
  - Commit/Run: `7b13713` / GitHub Actions run `38234823425` (Job `114762989410`, Artifact `11749751147`)
  - Notes: Executed full downstream suite producing authentic `DownstreamTestsResult.xcresult` with 260/260 passing tests (0 failures). Verified all 8 production-path master scenario tests (`CHAT-24`, `SH-03`, `SH-05`, `CMD-04`, `ZIP-04`, `ZIP-07`, `ZIP-11`, `COREAI-06`). Built unsigned IPA in 28m2s (`0a6923621cd817ad9741905f6043a3254e37e9417fb94442d88af23c4976b533`). Generated fail-closed acceptance matrix (10 passing semantic negative self-tests): 397 PASSED (80.5%), 83 NOT_RUN_DEVICE (16.8%), 10 BLOCKED_EXTERNAL (2.0%), 0 FAILED.

- [x] Pass 3 Apple Verification & Final Evidence Completion
  - Implemented: 2026-10-07
  - Commit/Run: `0c0025b` / GitHub Actions run `37587829849`
  - Notes: Executed full downstream app and simulator suites on real macOS 27 / Xcode 27 / iOS Simulator 27 infrastructure. Eliminated all 368 `NOT_RUN_PLATFORM` scenarios. Built 116MB unsigned Release IPA (`f6fe11fbaae74702b3c8e63907d58fea6d851481a6f97a9a08e1a489755b3347`). Resolved CabLate MCP-04 with exit code 0. Generated verified acceptance matrix and requirement results (R01–R47).
