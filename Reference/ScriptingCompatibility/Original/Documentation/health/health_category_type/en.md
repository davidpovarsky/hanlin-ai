The `HealthCategoryType` identifies discrete health-related states or events, often recorded as binary values (e.g., present or not present) or discrete outcomes. These are commonly used for tracking symptoms, reproductive health, audio exposure events, and sleep states.

## Use Cases

* **Reproductive Health Apps**: Use types like `menstrualFlow`, `ovulationTestResult`, `pregnancy`, and `lactation` to help users track fertility and cycles.
* **Mindfulness and Lifestyle**: Use `mindfulSession`, `handwashingEvent`, and `toothbrushingEvent` for promoting daily habits.
* **Sleep and Heart Monitoring**: Use `sleepAnalysis`, `sleepApneaEvent`, and heart rhythm-related types to provide nighttime and cardiovascular insights.
* **Symptom Trackers**: Use symptom-related types (e.g., `fatigue`, `fever`, `nausea`) in journaling, recovery, or diagnostics support apps.

## Example: Save a Sleep Stage Sample

```ts
const sample = HealthCategorySample.create({
  type: "sleepAnalysis",
  startDate: new Date("2025-07-03T22:30:00"),
  endDate: new Date("2025-07-04T06:30:00"),
  value: HealthCategoryValueSleepAnalysis.asleepDeep
})

await Health.saveCategorySample(sample)
```

---

## Example: Query Mindful Sessions

```ts
const results = await Health.queryCategorySamples({
  type: "mindfulSession",
  startDate: new Date("2025-07-01"),
  endDate: new Date("2025-07-05")
})

for (const session of results) {
  console.log("From", session.startDate, "to", session.endDate)
}
```

## Notes

* The `value` provided to a category sample must match the expected enum for the given `type`.
* If the `value` does not match the required category value type, the `create()` method will return `null`.
* Samples must span at least one second (`endDate > startDate`).
