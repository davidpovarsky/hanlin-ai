The `HealthWorkout` class provides a high-level interface for accessing and analyzing workout data from Apple Health. A workout represents a full session of physical activity, such as running, swimming, or cycling, recorded between a start and end time, and may include additional events and aggregated statistics.

## Use Cases

* Retrieve and display workout history
* Analyze workout types and durations
* Correlate workout sessions with metrics such as heart rate, calories burned, or distance
* Visualize workout events like pauses, resumes, laps, and segments
* Access health statistics collected during the workout session

## Related Types

### `HealthWorkoutActivityType`

Represents the type of physical activity, such as:

* `running`
* `walking`
* `cycling`
* `swimming`
* `yoga`
* ... and many more (see `HealthWorkoutActivityType` documentation)

### `HealthWorkoutEvent`

Represents a specific event during the workout, such as:

* pause
* resume
* motion paused/resumed
* lap or segment markers

### `HealthStatistics`

Provides calculated metrics such as:

* `averageQuantity()`
* `sumQuantity()`
* `maximumQuantity()`
* `minimumQuantity()`
* `mostRecentQuantity()`

These are based on health data samples (e.g., heart rate, energy burned) during the workout's time interval.

## Example Usage

```ts
function displayWorkoutSummary(workout: HealthWorkout) {
  console.log(`Workout ID: ${workout.uuid}`)
  console.log(`Activity Type: ${workout.workoutActivityType}`)
  console.log(`Start: ${workout.startDate.toISOString()}`)
  console.log(`End: ${workout.endDate.toISOString()}`)
  console.log(`Duration: ${(workout.duration / 60).toFixed(1)} minutes`)

  if (workout.metadata) {
    console.log(`Metadata: ${JSON.stringify(workout.metadata)}`)
  }

  if (workout.workoutEvents) {
    for (const event of workout.workoutEvents) {
      console.log(`Event: ${HealthWorkoutEventType[event.type]} at ${event.dateInterval.start.toISOString()}`)
    }
  }

  const heartRateStats = workout.allStatistics["heartRate"]
  if (heartRateStats) {
    console.log(`Average Heart Rate: ${heartRateStats.averageQuantity("count/min")} bpm`)
  }
}
```

## Notes

* `HealthWorkout` instances are typically retrieved using query APIs such as `Health.queryWorkouts()` (if available in the framework).
* The `allStatistics` property provides quick access to summary data without needing to query samples manually.
* Use the `workoutEvents` property to reconstruct the timeline of activity (e.g., when the user paused or resumed).
