## When to Use `HealthQuantityType`

You will provide a `HealthQuantityType` string when:

1. **Querying quantity samples**:

```ts
const results = await Health.queryQuantitySamples({
  type: "stepCount",
  startDate: new Date("2025-07-01"),
  endDate: new Date("2025-07-02")
})
```

2. **Writing a quantity sample**:

```ts
const sample = HealthQuantitySample.create({
  type: "bodyMass",
  unit: HealthUnit.gramUnit(HealthUnitPrefix.kilo),
  value: 70.0,
  startDate: new Date("2025-07-01 00:00:00"),
  endDate:  new Date("2025-07-02 00:00:00"),
})

await Health.saveQuantitySample(sample)
```

3. **Reading statistics from a workout**:

```ts
const stat = workout.allStatistics["heartRate"]
const avg = stat?.averageQuantity(HealthUnit.count().divided(HealthUnit.minute()))
```
