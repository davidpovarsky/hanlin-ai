The `BluetoothPeripheralManager` API enables your device to act as a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) peripheral. It allows you to:

* Advertise device name and service UUIDs
* Add or remove services with characteristics
* Handle read and write requests from central devices
* Notify subscribed centrals of characteristic value changes
* Manage connection parameters such as connection latency

This API is ideal for building custom sensor devices, BLE peripheral simulators, controllers, and similar use cases.

---

## Core Status Property

### `isAdvertising: Promise<boolean>`

Returns whether the device is currently advertising as a peripheral.

```ts
const advertising = await BluetoothPeripheralManager.isAdvertising
console.log(advertising ? "Advertising" : "Not advertising")
```

---

## Advertising Control

### `startAdvertising(advertisementData: { localName?: string; serviceUUIDs?: string[] }): Promise<void>`

Begins BLE advertising with optional device name and service UUIDs.

```ts
await BluetoothPeripheralManager.startAdvertising({
  localName: "MyPeripheral",
  serviceUUIDs: ["1234", "ABCD"]
})
```

---

### `stopAdvertising(): Promise<void>`

Stops ongoing BLE advertising.

```ts
await BluetoothPeripheralManager.stopAdvertising()
```

---

## Service Management

### `addService(service): Promise<void>`

Adds a service and its characteristics to the peripheral.

**Parameters:**

```ts
{
  uuid: string,
  characteristics: Array<{
    uuid: string,
    properties: string[], // e.g., ["read", "notify"]
    permissions: string[], // e.g., ["readable"]
    value?: Data
  }>
}
```

**Example:**

```ts
await BluetoothPeripheralManager.addService({
  uuid: "180F",
  characteristics: [
    {
      uuid: "2A19",
      properties: ["read", "notify"],
      permissions: ["readable"],
      value: Data.fromIntArray([85]) // 85% battery
    }
  ]
})
```

---

### `removeService(serviceUUID: string): Promise<void>`

Removes a previously added service by its UUID.

---

### `removeAllServices(): Promise<void>`

Removes all services added by the current script.

---

## Event Handlers for Central Interaction

### `onRestoreState: ((state) => void) | null`

Called when the system restores your script due to a background BLE session. Useful for restoring service and advertising state.

```ts
BluetoothPeripheralManager.onRestoreState = (state) => {
  console.log("Restored state. Services count:", state.services.length)
}
```

```ts
type RestoreState = {
  services: BluetoothServiceInfo[]
  advertisementData: BluetoothAdvertisementData
}
```

---

### `onReadyToUpdateSubscribers: (() => void) | null`

Called when the system's transmission queue is cleared and ready to send notifications again after a previous failure due to queue congestion.

```ts
BluetoothPeripheralManager.onReadyToUpdateSubscribers = () => {
  console.log("Ready to resend notifications")
}
```

---

### `onReadCharacteristicValue: (characteristicId, offset, central) => Promise<{result, value}>`

Invoked when a remote central requests to read a characteristic.

If not implemented, the system returns `readNotPermitted`.

```ts
BluetoothPeripheralManager.onReadCharacteristicValue = async (id, offset, central) => {
  if (id === "2A19") {
    return {
      result: BluetoothATTResponseCode.success,
      value: Data.fromIntArray([85]) // battery level
    }
  }
  return { result: BluetoothATTResponseCode.attributeNotFound }
}
```

**Signature:**

```ts
(
  characteristicId: string,
  offset: number,
  central: {
    id: string,
    maximumUpdateValueLength: number
  }
) => Promise<{
  result: BluetoothATTResponseCode,
  value?: Data | null
}>
```

---

### `onWriteCharacteristicValue: (characteristicId, offset, value, central) => Promise<BluetoothATTResponseCode>`

Invoked when a remote central attempts to write to a characteristic.

If not implemented, the system returns `writeNotPermitted`.

```ts
BluetoothPeripheralManager.onWriteCharacteristicValue = async (id, offset, value, central) => {
  console.log(`Write request to ${id}:`, value.toIntArray())
  if (id === "2A19") {
    return BluetoothATTResponseCode.success
  }
  return BluetoothATTResponseCode.attributeNotFound
}
```

**Signature:**

```ts
(
  characteristicId: string,
  offset: number,
  value: Data,
  central: {
    id: string,
    maximumUpdateValueLength: number
  }
) => Promise<BluetoothATTResponseCode>
```

---

### `onSubscribe: (characteristicId, central) => void`

Called when a central subscribes to a characteristic that supports notifications or indications.

```ts
BluetoothPeripheralManager.onSubscribe = (id, central) => {
  console.log(`Central ${central.id} subscribed to ${id}`)
}
```

---

### `onUnsubscribe: (characteristicId, central) => void`

Called when a central unsubscribes from a characteristic.

```ts
BluetoothPeripheralManager.onUnsubscribe = (id, central) => {
  console.log(`Central ${central.id} unsubscribed from ${id}`)
}
```

---

## Notifications and Subscriptions

### `getSubscribers(characteristicId: string): Promise<Central[]>`

Returns a list of central devices currently subscribed to a given characteristic.

Each item:

```ts
{
  id: string,
  maximumUpdateValueLength: number
}
```

---

### `updateValue(characteristicId: string, value: Data, options?): Promise<boolean>`

Sends a notification or indication to all subscribed centrals (or a specified subset) with the updated characteristic value.

**Returns:**

* `true`: Successfully sent
* `false`: Queue is full — wait for `onReadyToUpdateSubscribers` before retrying

---

## Connection Parameters

### `setDesiredConnectionLatency(centralId: string, latency): Promise<void>`

Sets the preferred connection latency for a specific central device.

* `"low"` – Faster interaction, higher power usage
* `"medium"` – Balanced
* `"high"` – Lower power usage, less frequent interaction

---
