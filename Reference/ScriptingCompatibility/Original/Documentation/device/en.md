The `Device` namespace provides access to information about the current device and its environment, including hardware characteristics, system details, screen metrics, battery status, orientation, proximity sensor state, locale and language settings, wake lock control, and network interfaces.

This API is commonly used to adapt UI layouts, behavior, and feature availability based on the device’s runtime context.
