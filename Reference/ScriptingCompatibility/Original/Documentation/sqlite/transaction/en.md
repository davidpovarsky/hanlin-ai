This section describes the transaction model, transaction types.

The SQLite transaction API uses a **step-based, declarative model** to provide predictable, controlled, and safe transaction behavior at the scripting level.

---

## Transaction Overview

A transaction groups multiple database operations into a single atomic unit:

* All steps succeed → the transaction is committed
* Any step fails → the transaction is rolled back
* After rollback, the database remains unchanged

SQLite guarantees consistency and isolation internally. JavaScript code does not need to manually handle rollback logic.

---

## transaction

```ts
db.transaction(
  steps: TransactionStep[],
  options?: {
    kind?: "deferred" | "immediate" | "exclusive"
  }
): Promise<void>
```

`transaction` executes a transaction defined by an ordered list of SQL steps.

---

## Transaction Steps

```ts
type TransactionStep = {
  sql: string
  args?: Arguments | null
}
```

Each transaction step consists of:

* `sql`: the SQL statement to execute
* `args`: optional bound parameters

Example:

```ts
await db.transaction([
  {
    sql: "INSERT INTO user (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)",
    args: ["Tom", 18]
  },
  {
    sql: "INSERT INTO user (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)",
    args: ["Lucy", 20]
  }
])
```

Steps are executed sequentially in the order they are declared.

## Transaction Kinds

Transactions support three kinds, corresponding to SQLite’s native transaction modes:

```ts
kind?: "deferred" | "immediate" | "exclusive"
```

---

### deferred

The default transaction kind.

* No locks are acquired when the transaction begins
* Locks are obtained only when the first read or write occurs
* Suitable for most general-purpose transaction scenarios

---

### immediate

* Attempts to acquire a write lock immediately when the transaction begins
* Fails immediately if the write lock cannot be acquired
* Useful when subsequent write operations must be guaranteed to proceed

---

### exclusive

* Acquires an exclusive lock when the transaction begins
* Blocks all other read and write operations
* Intended for scenarios that require full database exclusivity

---

## Error Handling and Rollback

A transaction will be rolled back automatically if any of the following occur:

* SQL execution errors
* Parameter binding errors
* Constraint violations (unique, foreign key, etc.)
* Database lock conflicts

Example:

```ts
try {
  await db.transaction([
    { sql: "INSERT INTO user (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Tom')" },
    { sql: "INSERT INTO user (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Lucy')" }
  ])
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Transaction failed:", e)
}
```

---

## Usage Recommendations

* Group operations that must succeed together into a single transaction
* Prefer the default `deferred` transaction kind
* Use `immediate` when early write-lock acquisition is required
* Avoid long-running or unrelated work inside transactions
* Do not rely on conditional logic to determine transaction steps

## Next Steps

After working with transactions, you may want to:

* Create and manage table schemas
* Define indexes and constraints
* Inspect database schema information
