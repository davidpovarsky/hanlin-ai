The SQLite module provides a structured, type-friendly, and predictable API for working with SQLite databases in Scripting.

SQLite is exposed as a **global namespace** and does not require importing. It supports both disk-based and in-memory databases, and covers common use cases such as executing SQL statements, performing queries, managing transactions, defining schemas, and inspecting database structures.

## Getting Started

### Opening a Database

```ts
const dbPath = Path.join(FileManager.appGroupDocumentsDirectory, "app.db")
const db = SQLite.open(dbPath)
```

Opens a SQLite database located in the script’s data directory. If the file does not exist, it will be created automatically.

To open an in-memory database:

```ts
const db = SQLite.openInMemory("temp")
```

---

### Executing SQL

```ts
await db.execute(
  "CREATE TABLE user (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER)"
)

await db.execute(
  "INSERT INTO user (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)",
  ["Tom", 18]
)
```

Both positional parameters and named parameters are supported.

---

### Querying Data

```ts
const users = await db.fetchAll<{ name: string; age: number }>(
  "SELECT name, age FROM user"
)

const user = await db.fetchOne<{ name: string }>(
  "SELECT name FROM user WHERE age = ?",
  [18]
)
```

---

### Using Transactions

```ts
await db.transaction([
  { sql: "INSERT INTO user (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)", args: ["Tom", 18] },
  { sql: "INSERT INTO user (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)", args: ["Lucy", 20] }
])
```

Transactions are declared as an ordered list of steps. All steps are executed sequentially, and any failure will cause the entire transaction to roll back.

## Core Capabilities

The SQLite module provides the following core capabilities:

* Database connection management
* SQL execution with parameter binding
* Structured data querying
* Explicit transaction control
* Table and index creation and removal
* Database schema inspection

---

## Documentation Structure

The SQLite documentation is organized by functional areas. Refer to the following sections based on your needs:

* **Database & Connection**
  Opening databases, configuration options, read-only mode, and concurrency behavior

* **Executing SQL & Queries**
  Executing SQL statements, parameter binding rules, and query APIs

* **Transactions**
  Transaction model, transaction kinds, and design constraints

* **Schema Management**
  Creating and managing tables and indexes using structured APIs

* **Schema Introspection**
  Inspecting tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes

* **Types Reference**
  Type definitions and enums used throughout the SQLite module

---

## Use Cases

The SQLite module is suitable for the following scenarios:

* Local data persistence
* Script-level caching and state storage
* Managing small to medium-sized structured datasets
* Building SQLite-based utility scripts
* Data migration, inspection, and debugging tools
