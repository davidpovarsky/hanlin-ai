The Conversation APIs are used to **start, control, and present a system-hosted Assistant chat session**.
A conversation corresponds to a **fully managed chat page**, where Scripting handles the UI, streaming output, provider selection, and message lifecycle.

Key differences from other Assistant APIs:

* Conversation APIs are designed for **interactive chat experiences**
* UI, streaming, and message handling are managed by the system
* Developers control **when the conversation starts, ends, and is shown**

---

## Conversation Lifecycle

A typical conversation follows this lifecycle:

1. `startConversation` — create a conversation (optionally auto-start)
2. `present` — display the Assistant chat page
3. User interacts with the Assistant
4. `dismiss` — temporarily hide the chat page (conversation continues)
5. `present` — show the same conversation again
6. `stopConversation` — terminate the conversation and release resources

Important rules:

* **Only one active conversation can exist at a time**
* Calling `startConversation` while a conversation is active throws an error
* Calling `stopConversation` automatically calls `dismiss`

---

## startConversation

### API Definition

```ts
function startConversation(options: {
  message: string
  images?: UIImage[]
  autoStart?: boolean
  systemPrompt?: string
  modelId?: string
  provider?: Provider
}): Promise<void>
```

---

### Parameters

#### options.message

* Type: `string`
* Required
* The **initial user message** of the conversation
* Equivalent to the first user input in the chat UI

---

#### options.images (optional)

* Type: `UIImage[]`
* Sent together with the initial message
* Common use cases:

  * Image analysis
  * Starting a conversation from a photo or screenshot

---

#### options.autoStart (optional)

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Behavior:

* `true`

  * The assistant immediately starts generating a reply
* `false`

  * The conversation is created but not sent automatically
  * Typically used when the user should press “Send” manually

---

#### options.systemPrompt (optional)

* Type: `string`

Behavior:

* If omitted:

  * The built-in Scripting Assistant system prompt is used
  * Assistant Tools are available
* If provided:

  * Fully replaces the default system prompt
  * **Assistant Tools are disabled**

Typical use cases:

* Creating a highly customized chat role
* Running the model without any tool access

---

#### options.modelId (optional)

* Type: `string`
* Specifies the model to use for this conversation
* Users may still change the model in the chat UI (if allowed)

---

#### options.provider (optional)

* Type: `Provider`
* Specifies the default provider for the conversation
* Users may change the provider in the chat UI (if allowed)

---

### Return Value

```ts
Promise<void>
```

* Resolves when the conversation is successfully created
* Rejects if a conversation already exists

---

## present

### API Definition

```ts
function present(): Promise<void>
```

---

### Behavior

* Presents the Assistant chat page for the current conversation
* If the page is already presented, calling this has no effect
* Can be called:

  * After `startConversation`
  * After `dismiss` to re-present the same conversation

---

### Return Value

```ts
Promise<void>
```

* Resolves when the chat page is dismissed by the user

---

## dismiss

### API Definition

```ts
function dismiss(): Promise<void>
```

---

### Behavior

* Dismisses the Assistant chat page
* **Does not stop the conversation**
* Conversation state and history are preserved

Typical use cases:

* Temporarily hiding the chat UI
* Navigating to another page or task

---

### Return Value

```ts
Promise<void>
```

---

## stopConversation

### API Definition

```ts
function stopConversation(): Promise<void>
```

---

### Behavior

* Fully terminates the current conversation
* Automatically calls `dismiss`
* Cleans up conversation state and resources
* After calling this, a new conversation may be started

---

### Return Value

```ts
Promise<void>
```

---

## Conversation State Flags

### Assistant.isAvailable

```ts
const isAvailable: boolean
```

* Indicates whether the current user has access to the Assistant
* If `false`, all Conversation APIs are unavailable

---

### Assistant.isPresented

```ts
const isPresented: boolean
```

* Indicates whether the Assistant chat page is currently presented

---

### Assistant.hasActiveConversation

```ts
const hasActiveConversation: boolean
```

* Indicates whether there is an active conversation
* Commonly used to guard against duplicate `startConversation` calls

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Typical usage

```ts
await Assistant.startConversation({
  message: "Help me summarize this article.",
  autoStart: true
})

await Assistant.present()
```

---

### Example 2: Create a conversation without auto-sending

```ts
await Assistant.startConversation({
  message: "Let's discuss system architecture design.",
  autoStart: false
})

await Assistant.present()
// User manually presses Send in the UI
```

---

### Example 3: Dismiss and re-present the same conversation

```ts
await Assistant.startConversation({
  message: "Analyze this image.",
  images: [image],
  autoStart: true
})

await Assistant.present()

await Assistant.dismiss()

// Later, re-present the same conversation
await Assistant.present()
```

---

### Example 4: Stop the current conversation and start a new one

```ts
if (Assistant.hasActiveConversation) {
  await Assistant.stopConversation()
}

await Assistant.startConversation({
  message: "Start a new topic.",
  autoStart: true
})

await Assistant.present()
```

---

## Best Practices

* Treat Conversation APIs as a **managed chat UI**
* Do not mix Conversation APIs with `requestStreaming` in the same flow
* Always check `hasActiveConversation` before calling `startConversation`
* For one-shot or data-oriented tasks, prefer:

  * `requestStructuredData`
  * `requestStreaming`
* Use Conversation APIs when continuous user interaction is required

---

## Design Boundaries

* Conversation APIs are not suitable for headless or background tasks
* Not intended for fully automated workflows
* Not ideal when you need strict control over prompts, tokens, or output format
